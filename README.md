# Is Web3 Open Science Yet?
This repo aspires to track the progress of the Web3 community as it utilizes cryptography, incentive engineering, and p2p networks to solve problems in Open Science. Inspired by https://www.arewewebyet.org/.

This is work in progress and we need your contributions! Open an issue to start a conversation about a problem, a project, or a way forward. 

The obstacles to Open Science listed below are tagged with these status emojis:

ðŸ”§ There are established communities surrounding tooling for this problem.

ðŸŒµ People are working on this! But expect thorns 

ðŸ’€ To our knowledge, nobody is working on this

    How do we preserve research papers AND data? As universities and libraries are threatened with closures, how do we help research outlast the institutions that have been their stewards so far?
